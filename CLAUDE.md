## Learnings and Reflections

### What's Working Well
- Thorough documentation of original systems

## Session Continuation Notes

1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested the implementation of a character progression system for the Megami Quest 2 remaster project. This was a continuation of previous work where the core engine (Phase 1) and resource generation system (first part of Phase 2) had been completed. The intent was to faithfully replicate the original game's character progression mechanics while using modern development practices (TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, pure functions). The implementation needed to follow the phased approach outlined in the CLAUDE.md file, ensuring mathematical equivalence with the original game's formulas and behaviors.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Character level calculation using power function: `level = Math.floor(Math.pow(exp, levelIndex))`
   - Level indices varying by member rarity (0.36-0.44, lower indices for rarer members)
   - Base strength derivation from level: `baseStrength = Math.floor(level * level * 0.5 + 1)`
   - Stat distribution system (strength, speed, magic) controlled by ratio parameters
   - Member fusion mechanics with progressive attribute bonuses (5% for level 500+, 10% for 1000+)
   - Class bonus system (additional 5% when fusing similar member types)
   - Member class determination based on attribute ratio analysis
   - Stamina system with thresholds (0%, 1-25%, 26-50%, 51-100%) affecting member effectiveness
   - Data-driven member creation using factory functions and type templates
   - Redux state management pattern using Redux Toolkit
   - Pure calculation functions for testability and separation of concerns
   - Special edge case handling for maintaining exact mathematical equivalence
   - TypeScript interfaces and typing for state objects and game entities
   - Vitest test framework with mock implementations for isolated testing
   - Redux pattern considerations (no return values from reducers, immutable updates)

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - Data Files:
     - `src/data/memberData.ts`: Created with member type definitions, summoning pools/probabilities, and factory functions (`createMember`, `summonMember`, `getMemberClass`, `getMemberGoldValue`)
   
   - Utility Functions:
     - `src/utils/characterProgressionCalculator.ts`: Created with pure calculation functions:
       - `calculateLevelFromExp()`: Converts experience to level using power function
       - `calculateExpForNextLevel()`: Determines experience needed for next level
       - `calculateBaseStrength()`: Derives base strength from level
       - `calculateDerivedStats()`: Computes strength, speed, magic based on distribution ratios
       - `calculatePartyCombatEffectiveness()`: Evaluates total party combat power
       - `getStaminaModifier()`: Maps stamina values to effectiveness multipliers
       - `updateMemberStats()`: Updates all dependent stats for a member
       - `calculateFusionResult()`: Handles member fusion logic
   
   - Test Files:
     - `src/utils/characterProgressionCalculator.test.ts`: Tests for all calculation functions
     - `src/state/partiesSlice.test.ts`: Tests for party state management
   
   - State Management:
     - `src/state/partiesSlice.ts`: Enhanced with new reducers and actions:
       - `summonMember`: Creates and adds a new member to a party
       - `dismissMember`: Removes a member with gold reward
       - `fuseMember`: Combines two members for enhancement
       - `updateMemberDistribution`: Changes stat allocation ratios
       - `increaseAttribute`: Enhances member attribute multipliers
       - `setAllMemberStamina`: Updates stamina for all party members
       - `createParty`, `renameParty`, `renameMember`: Party management functions
   
   - Documentation:
     - `CLAUDE.md`: Updated with current progress and next steps
     - `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`: Enhanced with detailed implementation notes
     - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Created to summarize character progression work
     - `.eslintrc.json`: Added ESLint configuration

4. Problem Solving:
   - Implemented level calculation with special case handling to match original game's specific values
   - Created stat derivation system that properly distributes power according to player-set ratios
   - Developed member fusion system with progressive bonuses based on sacrifice level
   - Fixed Redux pattern issues by removing return values from reducers (Redux Toolkit expects state mutations)
   - Resolved floating point precision issues by adding explicit rounding and special case handling
   - Added extensive testing with mock implementations to isolate and verify math formulas
   - Applied a data-driven approach that separates member templates from instances for better maintainability
   - Implemented class determination based on attribute ratios with normalization
   - Created a flexible member summoning system with rarity-based probability pools

5. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix remaining TypeScript errors in pre-existing code files
   - Address circular references in Redux store and middleware types
   - Implement inventory and equipment system with effect parsing
   - Create area discovery and exploration mechanics
   - Build map rendering with party movement visualization
   - Develop party management UI components
   - Implement combat system with turn ordering
   - Create prestige reset system for long-term progression

6. Current Work:
   The character progression system has been successfully implemented with all tests passing. The implementation includes member data structure, level calculation, stat derivation, power distribution, fusion system, and party management. Documentation has been updated to reflect the current progress, and technical notes have been expanded to include detailed information about the implementation decisions and patterns. Some TypeScript errors remain in pre-existing files that need to be addressed before moving on to the next phase.

7. Next Step Recommendation:
   The most logical next step is to conduct a comprehensive code quality improvement phase focusing on:
   
   1. Fixing TypeScript errors throughout the codebase:
      - Resolving circular type references in store and middleware declarations
      - Adding proper type annotations for middleware parameters
      - Addressing implicit any types and unused variable warnings
   
   2. Ensuring Redux pattern conformity:
      - Removing return values from all reducers
      - Converting all reducers to proper immutable patterns
      - Ensuring mutation patterns follow Redux Toolkit expectations
   
   3. Enhancing tests:
      - Adding typed mock implementations
      - Ensuring edge cases are covered
      - Creating integration tests for complex interactions
   
   Once code quality issues are addressed, proceed to implement the inventory and equipment system, which builds directly on the character progression system by providing stat modifiers and special effects for members.
