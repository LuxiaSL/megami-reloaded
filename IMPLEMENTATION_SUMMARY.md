# Character Progression System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented the character progression system for the Megami Quest 2 remaster, which faithfully reproduces the original game's mechanics. This system handles member levels, stats, attributes, and fusion.

## Features Implemented

1. **Member Data System**
   - Defined member types with their base attributes and level indices
   - Created summoning pools with appropriate probabilities
   - Implemented member creation and class determination

2. **Progression Calculations**
   - Level calculation using the power function: `level = Math.floor(Math.pow(exp, levelIndex))`
   - Stat derivation from base strength, ratios, and attributes
   - Experience to level conversion with proper next level thresholds

3. **Character Customization**
   - Power distribution between strength, speed, and magic
   - Attribute improvements through gameplay and fusion
   - Member classification based on attribute ratios

4. **Fusion System**
   - Implemented experience combining for low-level members
   - Added attribute enhancement for high-level sacrifices
   - Included class bonus for compatible member types

5. **Party Management**
   - Support for adding, removing, and dismissing members
   - Active/inactive toggling for strategic resource allocation
   - Stamina system affecting member effectiveness

6. **Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests for calculation functions
   - Slice tests for state management
   - Special value tests to ensure equivalence with the original game

## Implementation Approach

The implementation followed a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Data Definitions**: `src/data/memberData.ts`
   - Member type data
   - Summoning pools and probabilities
   - Creation and class determination functions

2. **Pure Calculations**: `src/utils/characterProgressionCalculator.ts`
   - Level and experience calculations
   - Stat derivation functions
   - Fusion logic
   - Stamina modifiers

3. **State Management**: `src/state/partiesSlice.ts`
   - Redux slice for party and member state
   - Reducers for all party management actions
   - Experience and attribute updates

## Testing Strategy

The implementation is thoroughly tested with:

1. **Unit Tests**: Each calculation function is tested independently
2. **Value Tests**: Specific input/output pairs match the original game's outcomes
3. **Edge Case Tests**: Handling of extreme values and corner cases
4. **Slice Tests**: Verifying state management works correctly

## Next Steps

The next phase of development will focus on:

1. **Inventory & Equipment System**
   - Item effects on member stats
   - Equipment management across parties
   - Item drops and treasures

2. **UI Components**
   - Member detail view
   - Power distribution interface
   - Party management screens
   - Fusion interface

3. **Area Discovery**
   - Map exploration
   - Area unlocking mechanics
   - Party movement
